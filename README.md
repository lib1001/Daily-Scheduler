## Usage

To use this daily schedular, the user will first be presented with today's date, followed by a calendar that is broken down into typical workday hours. As a visual aid, the colors of each hour block will change depending on the current time. Past hours will be shown in grey, the current hour will be shown in red, and future hours will be shown in green. The hour that each row represents will be shown on the far-most left side of the screen. Directly to the right of the date is a box that allows the user to input data for any given time block. On the right is a save button. When pressed, the user input will be saved to local storage. If the user leaves or refreshes the page, there are no worries because that saved data will still be on the screen when the page is revisited.
